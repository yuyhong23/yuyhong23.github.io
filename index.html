									Hi, this is Yuying, a data analyst who is passionate about net zero carbon economy. I was born in Guangdong, China and grew up in San Francisco.
								</p>
								<h3>Education & Career Interest</h3>
								<br>
								<p>
									I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2019 with a dual degree in Environmental Economics and Policy and Asian Studies. 
								</p>
								<p>
									After graduation, while pondering my next move in life, I worked as an operations associate at Foodnet Supermarket Inc from October 2019 to February 2021. During my time at Foodnet Supermarket, I was exposed to various operational tasks, such as marketing, operating POS (point of sale) system backends, and managing newly launched E-commerce platforms. Thanks to my experience at Foodnet Supermarket, I realized that I am surprisingly comfortable working with technologies and is interested in data analytics.
								</p>
								<p>
									After realizing my newfound career interest, I decided to attend UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp (from October 2020 to April 2021) to acquire the skills needed to become a data analyst.
								</p>
								<p>
									Currently, I am looking for a full-time data analytst/consultant position to utilize and further develop my skills. Since climate change is an issue that I am especially concerned about, I am looking specifically into the environmental related sector for job opportunities. For the prospects of our world, I believe that our economy needs to transition into a net zero carbon economy swiftly; thus, I am eager to apply my data analytics skills to assist such transition.
								</p>
								<h3>Hobbies & Other Interests</h3>		
								<br>
								<p>
									I enjoy being both physically active and mentally active. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I have tried out many different sports before, recently I am more into hiking. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I like listening to music and podcasts. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Music is my caffeine; it boosts my energy and productivity. One of my favorite songs is Saho Terao’s “Cloud.” 
								</p>
								<p>
									Podcast is a great way to gain some "random" knowledge. Usually I like to listen to podcasts on brain related topics and international relations related topics (usually focus on East Asian countries). Some of my favorite podcasts are Hidden Brain, Invisibilia, and ChinaTalk.
								</p>
								<p>
									I also like to read and write. I am currently reading <em>The Third Industrial Revolution</em> by Jeremy Rifkin and <em>On Earth We’re Beriefly Gorgeous</em> by Ocean Vuong.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am not a big fan of TV dramas and movies, but I do like to watch animated movies and Japanese anime. My favorite movie is <em>Alice in Wonderland (2010)</em>, and my favorite anime is <em>Mushishi</em>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Last but not least, you may wonder why the theme of my website is cloud. That is because I always enjoy watching the ever-changing clouds floating in the sky, for I am watching the endless possibilities that are happening on a finite canvas.
								</p>
